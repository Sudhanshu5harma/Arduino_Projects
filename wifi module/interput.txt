Syntax
attachInterrupt(interrupt, ISR, mode)

attachInterrupt(pin, ISR, mode) (Arduino Due only)

Parameters

interrupt:the number of the interrupt (int)

pin:the pin number(Arduino Due only)

ISR:the ISR to call when the interrupt occurs; this function must take no parameters and return nothing. This function is sometimes referred to as aninterrupt service routine.mode:defines when the interrupt should be triggered. Four contstants are predefined as valid values:

(1) LOW: to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin is low,

(2) CHANGE: to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin changes value

(3) RISING: to trigger when the pin goes from low to high,

(4) FALLING: for when the pin goes from high to low.
